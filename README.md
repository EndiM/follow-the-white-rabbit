Type `npm install` to install all necessary node modules.<br/>
Type `npm start` or `npm run start` to start development in your default browser.

Sometimes there is a problem with webpack-dev-server recompiling code and refreshing page. Cancel the `npm start` command and run it again.

Widget uses some features that don't have support in older browsers (clip-path, shape-outside), so please use more recent version
of browsers.
